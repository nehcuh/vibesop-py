## Technical Pitfalls

### Trusted External Skills with Audit Warnings (2026-04-19)

**Issue**: When allowing trusted external skill packs (gstack, superpowers) through security audit despite non-critical threats, tests may fail because they expect `is_safe=True` for all loaded skills.

**Root Cause**: The code intentionally allows trusted skills through with benign warnings (e.g., role-prompting language), but `is_safe` property remains `False` because it's computed from `audit_result.is_safe`.

**Solution**: Update tests to check that loaded skills are either safe OR trusted with non-critical threats:

```python
from vibesop.security.skill_auditor import ThreatLevel

is_trusted_safe = (
    skill.external_metadata.is_safe or
    (skill.external_metadata.is_trusted and
     skill.external_metadata.audit_result and
     skill.external_metadata.audit_result.risk_level != ThreatLevel.CRITICAL)
)
assert is_trusted_safe, "Skill should be safe or trusted with non-critical threats"
```

### Test Data Mismatch: Registry vs Filesystem Skills (2026-04-19)

**Issue**: Tests trying to instantiate built-in registry skills (e.g., "systematic-debugging") fail because `SkillManager.get_skill_instance()` only works for filesystem skills.

**Root Cause**: Built-in skills are loaded from YAML registry, not filesystem. `loader.instantiate()` returns `None` for registry-only skills.

**Solution**: Use actual filesystem skills with proper namespace:
- ❌ Wrong: `"systematic-debugging"` (registry-only)
- ✅ Correct: `"builtin/systematic-debugging"` (filesystem)
- ✅ Correct: `"gstack/office-hours"` (external pack)

### Performance Regression from Logging Overhead (2026-04-19)

**Issue**: Adding `logger.warning()` calls for 23+ trusted skills during loading caused 8% performance regression (50 QPS → 46 QPS).

**Root Cause**: Even at WARNING level, logging has overhead. When called for every trusted skill during discovery, it accumulates.

**Solution**:
1. Remove logging entirely for expected cases (trusted skills with non-critical threats)
2. Or use DEBUG level for informational messages
3. Adjust performance targets to account for enhanced security

**Optimized Code**:
```python
# Before: 23+ logger.warning() calls
if ext_metadata.audit_result.risk_level != ThreatLevel.CRITICAL:
    logger.warning(...)  # Overhead!

# After: No logging for expected cases
if ext_metadata.audit_result.risk_level == ThreatLevel.CRITICAL:
    continue
# Skip logging - trusted skills are expected
```

## Reusable Patterns

### UltraQA Autonomous Testing Cycle

**Pattern**: Systematic QA testing with architect diagnosis before fixes.

**Workflow**:
1. **Discover**: Run test suite to find all bugs
2. **Diagnose**: Analyze root causes before fixing (architect review)
3. **Fix**: Apply targeted fixes based on diagnosis
4. **Verify**: Re-run tests to confirm fixes
5. **Cycle**: Repeat until no new bugs found

**Example**:
```bash
# Discover bugs
pytest --tb=no -q

# Diagnose each bug with architect review
# Read code, understand intent, identify root cause

# Apply targeted fixes
# Verify each fix individually
pytest tests/path/to/test.py
```

**Key Principle**: Never fix without diagnosis. Prevents thrashing and ensures correct solutions.

## Architecture Decisions

### Trusted External Skills Security Model (2026-04-19)

**Decision**: Allow trusted external skill packs (gstack, superpowers) through security audit despite non-critical threats, while blocking CRITICAL threats.

**Rationale**:
- Trusted packs contain legitimate role-prompting language that triggers benign role-hijacking heuristics
- Example: "You are a code reviewer" triggers the rule, but is not actual hijacking
- CRITICAL threats (privilege escalation, jailbreaks) are always blocked
- Users explicitly install these packs and trust them

**Implementation**:
```python
if ext_metadata.is_trusted and ext_metadata.audit_result:
    if ext_metadata.audit_result.risk_level != ThreatLevel.CRITICAL:
        # Allow through with no logging (expected case)
        pass
    else:
        continue  # Block CRITICAL threats even for trusted packs
```

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Pros: Allows legitimate trusted packs, reduces false positives
- ⚠️ Cons: Requires updating test expectations, small performance overhead (~8%)
- 🎯 Decision: Security correctness > performance, optimize logging later

**Files**:
- `src/vibesop/core/skills/loader.py` (lines 161-180)
- `src/vibesop/security/rules.py` (removed overly broad pattern)
- `tests/integration/test_external_skill_execution.py` (updated test expectations)
